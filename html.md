### Observations/Notes from this lecture -
 
1. HTML is indeed a syntactical language, and it is both simple and declarative in nature. It is responsible for defining the structure of web pages, which is why it's often referred to as a structural language.
2. The difference between the h1 and h2 tags isn't solely about the visible size of headings on the UI. It's important to note that HTML tags provide a semantic hierarchy to content, with h1 being the highest level of importance (usually the main title), and h2 being a subheading of lesser importance. This semantic structure aids accessibility and SEO.
3. HTML tags are indeed case-insensitive. This means that you can write tags in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture of both, and the browser will interpret them the same way. For example, <html>, <HTML>, and <HtMl> are all treated as the same tag.
4. In the "index.html" file, several HTML tags are present. In the beginning, we encounter the "<!DOCTYPE html>" declaration, signifying the file's HTML type. Subsequently, the HTML file follows this structure:	
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html lang="en">
		<head>
			<!-- Content in the head section, like metadata, CSS links, etc. -->
		</head>
		<body>
			<!-- Content in the body section, visible to users on the webpage -->
		</body>
		</html>
Additionally, while the "title" tag in the head section contributes to what's displayed in the browser's title bar or tab, the "favicon" (shortcut icon) is a small image that appears next to the title in the browser tab or window.
