-> In JavaScript, if you want to use a symbol as an object key, you must use bracket notation ([ ]). This is because symbol keys are not strings, and JavaScript expects symbol keys to be wrapped in brackets for differentiation.
-> Without the brackets, as in mySym: 'mykey1', JavaScript interprets mySym as a regular string key, not as the symbol created by Symbol('key1').
